Action Center Data App Privacy Policy
--------------------------
### Introduction ###
Our privacy policy will help you understand what information we collect at Action Center, how Action Center uses it, and what choices you have.
Action Center Dev Team built the Action Center Data App as a free app. This SERVICE is provided by Action Center Data App at no cost and is intended for use as is.
If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible on our website, unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

### Information Collection and Use ###
For a better experience while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to the user’s name, email address, contact number, location, and pictures. The information that we request will be retained by us and used as described in this Privacy Policy.
The app does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.

### Prominent Disclosure & Consent: ###
Upon user registration, and before accessing the full features of the app, including submitting incident reports, the app will present a geolocation consent screen. Users must read and check the consent checkbox before completing the registration process. By checking this consent, you agree to allow the app to access your device’s geolocation data. This data is essential for accurately locating incidents when reports are submitted. The geolocation data will be used solely for this purpose and will not be shared without your explicit consent, except as required to provide services or comply with legal obligations.

Failure to agree to the geolocation consent will prevent registration and use of the app's main feature (incident reporting). We ensure that the collection and use of geolocation data are transparent and necessary for the functionality of the app.

### Cookies ###
Cookies are files with a small amount of data commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites you visit and are stored on your device’s internal memory.
This Service does not explicitly use these “cookies.” However, the app may use third-party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies, and you will be informed when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, some portions of this Service may not be accessible.

### Location Information ###
Some of the services may use location information transmitted from users' mobile phones. Specifically, the app collects and uses geolocation data during the submission of incident reports to pinpoint the exact location of the reported incident. This data will be used solely for the purpose of improving the accuracy of the reports and assisting in providing the necessary response. The geolocation data will be handled responsibly and will not be shared without the user's explicit consent except for the intended purposes.

### Device Information ###
We collect information from your device in some cases. The information will be utilized for the provision of better service and to prevent fraudulent acts. Additionally, such information will not include details that identify the individual user.

### Service Providers ###
We may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:

*To facilitate our Service;
*To provide the Service on our behalf;
*To perform Service-related services; or
*To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.
*We want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

### Security ###
We value your trust in providing us with your Personal Information, thus we strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. However, remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy ###
